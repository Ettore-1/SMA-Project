# SMA-Project

## Goal of this practice:

The goal is to use a cloud computing platform (the Google Cloud Platform). We will use big data tools on Colab to process large datasets. These data are real satellite observations of the ocean (5 years).
The project is around Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Height analysis and predictions.

## Evaluation of this practice:

I will evaluate 3 main components.
- The first is the quality of the code. It must be concise and well written. The goal is to manipulate big data tools provided by the Google Cloud Platform (such as BigQuery).
- The second is the quality of the outputs. Never forget that you are dealing with physical variables evolving in space and time. You must use maps and time series. You must also write the units (e.g., Â°C, m).
- The third thing is the discussion about your results. Again, remember that you are dealing with oceanographic data. They have a physical meaning and you should be able to comment the outputs.
